# flaapworks-ssr

This project is an adaptation of my portfolio (https://github.com/Poolchaos/flaapworks-vue), which was built in vue3.
As NUXTJS 3 is still in progress, I decided to clone and downgrade to vue2, which is this project.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
